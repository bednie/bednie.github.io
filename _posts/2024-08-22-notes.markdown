Notes:
1. Start thinking about group selection
2. Brainstorm project ideas 
1. Agile principles:
    - Why we are able to follow Agile principles:
        - Many of the principles can be adapted to our project
    - Why we are not able to follow Agile principles:
        - #3 might be difficult because we don't have a lot of time
        - #8 Maintaining a constant pace could be difficult with the 
        semester. For instance, midterms and finals might disrupt the pace. 
    - Adapt Agile principles to our own needs

Exercise:
1. Population of interest? 
    - People who use or might want to use [spaced repetition](https://borretti.me/article/spaced-repetition-checkpointing-learning)  to learn 
2. What is their need?
    - Keep track of what they should be learning or reviewing, since it can be hard to remember
3. Propose a product:
    - An app to keep track of their flashcards and to remind the user when and which task should be reviewed
