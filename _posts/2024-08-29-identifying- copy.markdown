For this assignment, we were asked to fork an existing repo and deploy a site using GitHub pages. I was comfortable with this process since I just set up this site a few days ago.

The next step was to make some edits to the site. I added my GitHub profile picture (Tom from Tom & Jerry) and found out that \<marquee> tags are still supported.
