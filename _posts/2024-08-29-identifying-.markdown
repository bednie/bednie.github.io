For this assignment, we had to come up with a product that would solve a customer's problem. 

This involves segmenting--we can't just say "everyone." Who has the problem? Why do they have it? Why aren't existing solutions good enough?

I adapted my machine learning class final project to this assignment. There are many popular solutions for face verification using cloud-connected "doorbells" and other devices. In settings where privacy and security are important, the cloud-connectedness is a major problem.
